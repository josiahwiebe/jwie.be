# Building The Blog

This article is going to be a multi-part series. I'm going to be building a personal blog using Next.js 13, Tailwind CSS, next-mdx-remote, Planetscale, and Prisma. I'm going to be writing about the process of building the site, as well as the tools I'm using.

1. [Getting Started with Next.js 13](/blog/building-a-personal-blog-with-nextjs-13-part-1)
2. [Building the Blog](/blog/building-a-personal-blog-with-nextjs-13-part-1) (this post)
3. Creating a Personal Feed with Planetscale and Prisma
4. Adding Authentication with Next-Auth.js

In my next post, I'll walk through the method I used to setup the blog and pages routes. I'll also show you how I use `next-mdx-remote` to render the blog posts and pages, combined with the power of dynamic catch-all route segments.
