I thought I'd try a different format for this year's review. I'm simply going to list out a few things I've done and haven't done, and then a few favourites.

# Haves

While travel was definitely a highlight, we also spent a lot of quality time at home. We did a lot bike riding, a bit of skiing, and enjoying those glorious Manitoba summers in the backyard.

It was a really mild winter, so skiing was super scarce, but thankfully we got some good snow starting in November, so ü§û for this season. The mild winter led into a mild spring, so I was able to get out on the bike earlier. Plus I got a new bike this year which was a lot of fun!

What a weirdo
:::

In addition to the usual work trips, we were fortunate to be able to get away for a few family vacations, as well as two couples trips. We got away to Cancun, Revelstoke, and Vancouver with the kids, aside from other more local getaways and camping outings. The two of us managed to get away to Toronto and New York City for two different long weekends as well.

As I'm writing this, I'm looking back at my year and I'm realizing there was a lot of new places! My first time at:

* Universal Studios
* New Mexico
* New York City
* Revelstoke
* Toronto
* Winnipeg

Maybe not mind-blowing destinations but surprising to me that I've never been to any of these places before. Here's to more new places in 2025!

We were fortunate to be able to visit a couple of restaurants that I've been wanting to try for a while.

* [Prime Seafood Palace](https://primeseafoodpalace.ca/) \- Toronto
* [SAGA](https://www.saga-nyc.com/) \- NYC
* [Osteria Giulia](https://osteriagiulia.ca/) \- Toronto

SAGA has a set menu, and there was a couple of winners in there. The atmosphere and view are what really sets it apart.

The duck breast at SAGA was excellent. This dish also got me hooked on persimmons.

The view from SAGA is also pretty legit.

Went to [React Miami](https://www.reactmiami.com/) in April which was probably the best conference I've ever attended. Met a lot of internet friends and made some new ones. Looking forward to attending again in 2025.

**Favourite Dish** \- _Cabbage w/ BBQ Chicken Skin_ at [Prime Seafood Palace](https://primeseafoodpalace.ca/) \- Toronto, or the _Pomelo Salad_ at [Bar Accanto](https://www.baraccanto.com/) \- Winnipeg

Unfortunately I don't have any photos of these, but they were both excellent.

**Favourite Ride** \- [LTV Cider Cycle](https://www.strava.com/activities/12343906285) \- RM of Stanley.

Not a long ride but so fun taking all of the LTV owners out for a ride.

**Most Surprising Place** \- Las Cruces, New Mexico.

First time in New Mexico (also in west Texas to get there), and I had zero expectations. It was a great surprise. Will be back.

**Favourite Podcast** \- The live episode of [Syntax.fm](https://syntax.fm/) at React Miami.

I'm not a podcast listener (like, at all), but I used to listen to Syntax.fm a lot. It was a blast to participate in this live ‚Äì Wes and Scott are true gems and great hosts.

**Best Paddleboarding** \- [Revelstoke Reservoir](https://www.strava.com/activities/11817838597) \- Revelstoke, BC.

Spent the best day paddling with the family and some friends on the Revelstoke Reservoir.

**Best Late-Night Snack** \- seared scallops w/ brown butter and broccolini

**Favourite Song** \- [Backfire](https://open.spotify.com/track/2IPshLLh6a1bzS9hDHqJ36?si=8093e701a62c46fb) by Wild Rivers. We were in Toronto to see them play at HISTORY. I also had [Two Friends](https://soundcloud.com/bigbootiemix) on the speakers a lot this year, especially out on the golf course.

**Favourite Apps**

* [Halide Camera](https://halide.cam/). - This is by no means a new app, but I got into using it again. Just makes taking photos fun again.
* [Overseer](https://overseer.dev/) \- This is a fantastic tool for managing your media library requests (especially if you have a Plex server).

**Favourite Movies**

* Wicked - ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
* The Fall Guy
* White Bird

**Favourite TV Series**

* The Bear
* The Day of the Jackal
* Little Drummer Girl - not from 2024 so it doesn't really count
* Death and Other Details
* Silo - only season 1 though

**Favourite Books**

I surpassed [my reading goal](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year%5Fin%5Fbooks/2024/3921541) of 32 books. Here's my top picks:

* Hyperion by Dan Simmons (and the rest of the series)
* The Midnight Feast by Lucy Foley
* Observer by Robert Lanza, Nancy Kress
* The Three Body Problem by Cixin Liu
* Wool by Hugh Howey

I read three full series this year, and all of them were excellent.
