_Technically, I got "TransPRK+ with iDesign Studio" but LASIK is the lingua franca for laser optical vision correction_

I've had glasses for as long as I can remember. I don't think there's a moment of my life when I remember waking up and just simply "seeing". I've tried contacts and never enjoyed them as they didn't feel like a full vision correction. As a matter of fact, I've actually always loved glasses – I probably have a dozen pairs or so.

However, I wanted to experience the feeling that so many people do without even thinking about it, so I scheduled a consult.

Initially, my consult ruled out LASIK due to thinner corneas, but after my final in-depth assessment, I was deemed eligible for either LASIK or PRK. I settled on PRK, partly due to this being my initial choice, and partly for some of the dry-eye, night vision, and corneal strength benefits.

I found myself approaching the surgery with nonchalance – and when the actual procedure came about, my feelings felt validated. It truly doesn't feel like a surgery at all. Everything was pretty much a walk in the park. 

0 day - Slept for about 45 minutes right after the procedure, woke up feeling pretty good. Iced my eyes for 15 minute intervals to prevent swelling. Rigorous drop schedule. Eyes feel gritty and vision is not great.

+1 day - Piece of cake. made some soup, went to a company Christmas event. Eyes are still gritty. Continuing with the drop and icing regimen.

+2 days - This was the only truly bad day. There were moments I regretted the whole thing. My surgeon swapped the protective contact bandage and there was a fuzz or some debris under it that was causing my pain. Once he removed it (which was an ordeal – nearly passed out), I had immediate relief.

\+ 3 days - Got the protective contact lens removed today. Vision feeling decent, no grittiness.

+7 days - One week consult. Vision test showing good results and re-growth of the corneal epithelium. I was able to get my driving license restriction removed and can now drive again!

+14 days - Vision is feeling like it's stabilizing a bit more but still has some room to improve.
