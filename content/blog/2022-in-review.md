In 2022, I began to settle into my new role at Leisure Travel Vans as the Marketing Manager. Travel, both for business and personally, started trickling back. Our oldest started kindergarten and our youngest turned two. We had a lot of quality family time, and lamented the departure of some of our closest friends.

## First Quarter

Winter felt a little bit more challenging than past years, but we made the most of it and got outside almost daily, regardless of the weather. We typically like to break up our winter with a Hawaiian vacation (this was an ongoing tradition pre-pandemic), but we didn't quite feel ready for travel at that time – Olsen was still 1yo and travel was still in a bit of a state of disarray.

Skating on our frozen rivers and creeks is a truly Canadian pastime, and we take advantage to the fullest. Lainey loves to skate, and Olsen was content to just enjoy the ride in the stroller.

## Second Quarter

As the spring came, along with it came a lot of hope for the year. The snow starts to melt, and with the flowing water washes away all of the challenges of winter. I was able to take my first work trip in a couple of years, where I visited one of our Travelers Clubs in the Outer Banks, North Carolina.

I had the opportunity to plan a new office for myself in our marketing space, as we planned to grow the team in within the year. I was able to get my hands dirty with some of the design and ideation, and I'm quite pleased with the end result.

We took a family trip down to Minneapolis for the May long weekend – our first family trip for the year. It was a great little getaway, and the hotel pool was a hit with the kids. Minneapolis is a fantastic city, I'd liken it to a Portland of the Midwest.

### Third Quarter

Settling into the full swing of summer. The kids (meaning me) got Katie a paddleboard for Mother's Day, so we spent a lot of time out on the water with it. I continued my 6am golf dates with Olsen.

We planned and booked a camping trip out to Vancouver for the end of summer, so I began eagerly working on some upgrades to our camper. We have a 2021 Winnebago Micro Minnie 2100BH. Most of the sites we booked were unserviced, so I wanted to do some power upgrades to ensure we had enough capacity to handle our off-grid sites. You can read more about those upgrades in the [logbook entry](https://ghost.burwal.de/logbook/2021-winnebago-micro-minnie-2100bh).

We returned home just in time for Lainey to start kindergarten, and then I headed off with the team to Hershey, Pennsylvania to launch our brand new Murphy Bed Lounge floorplan.

After a long hiatus from a lifetime growing up Nordic Skiing, I finally got back on the skis this year. Katie and I both purchased a new set of skis which we've been really happy with. They are the [Saloman Escape 6 Skin](https://www.salomon.com/en-int/shop-int/product/escape-6-skin-and-prolink-access.html#color=67766) – I've been really impressed with the skin technology.
