In the spring of 2022, the first prototypes of our brand new [Unity Murphy Bed Lounge](https://leisurevans.com/unity/features/murphy-bed-lounge) and [Wonder Murphy Bed Lounge](https://leisurevans.com/wonder/features/murphy-bed-lounge/) were completed at our factory in Winkler, Canada. This was a milestone for us – the first time launching a new floorplan on both our [Unity](https://leisurevans.com/unity/) & [Wonder](https://leisurevans.com/wonder/) product lines simultaneously.

We wanted to do something special to launch this new twin floorplan, so we came up with a plan to create some video content and host a live launch at the Hershey RV Show in Hershey, PA.

In summer, we shipped the coaches to Fraserway RV, one of our selling dealers. Our team flew to the Okanagan to film a product walkthrough video on each model, as well as capture some scenic aerial and car-to-car driving shots.

We like to keep our gear loadout lean and portable, and we've fine-tuned our setup pretty well over the years.

For our walkthroughs, we have two each of the following:

- [Canon R5](https://www.canon.ca/en/product?name=EOS_R5)
- Canon EF 14mm f/2.8L II - the widest rectilinear lens in the Canon lineup
- Canon RF 50mm f/1.2L USM - for the tight angle
- [DJI Ronin-S2](https://www.dji.com/ca/rs-2)

For this shoot, we recorded audio onto two independent on-talent recorders. Our audio setup has changed since this shoot – we're now using:

- [Rode Wireless Go](https://rode.com/en/microphones/wireless/wirelessgo)
- Zoom F2-BT Field Recorder - for on-talent recording
- Zoom F3 Field Recorder - connected to the Rode system for remote recording with live monitoring

For aerial and car-to-car, we use the following:

- [DJI Mavic 2 Pro](https://www.dji.com/ca/mavic-2)
- [Tilta Hydra Alien Car Mount](https://tilta.com/shop/hydra-alien-car-mounting-system-pro-kit/)

The beauty of this setup is that it all fits into two Pelican cases, making it super easy to transport, and we can get it all set up in under 20 minutes.
