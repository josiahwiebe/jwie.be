_Originally published January 23, 2017. Information may be out of date._

The Big Island of Hawaii has always been a very special place for us. We first visited in 2012 and returned every single year after that, up until the COVID-19 pandemic.

This document is intended to be living document, documenting our favourite places and things to do on the Big Island â€“Â designed with the intention of being shared with friends and family.

# Background

- The primary airport (KOA) is located on the Kohala Coast, about 15 kilometres (30 minutes) north of Kona. A few options:
  - Rent a car - this is pretty much required on the Big Island
  - Taxi
  - Hitchhiking (mixed results, but can be fun)
- Trespassing & private property. The Big Island is a very special place, but keep in mind that you are a visitor on native Hawaiian land. Respect the land and the people.
- Kona coffee isn't all that good ðŸ˜… People think that it is, but they are wrong. Still fun to go on a free coffee tour though.
- The Big Island has eight of our planet's 13 different climate zones. Be prepared for all of them.

# Regions

It's simplest to divide the Big Island up into a few distinct regions:

- **Kona**
  - the most popular region, known for its beaches, coffee, and the town of Kona.
  - the Kailua-Kona town area extends a fair ways down the western coast, and includes Kailua-Kona proper, Kealakekua Bay, Captain Cook, etc
- **Kohala**
  - the northernmost region, known for its beaches, golf courses, and the town of Waimea.
  - includes the **Waikoloa Beach** resort area (not to be confused with Waikoloa Village), the Mauna Lani Resort, and the **Hapuna Beach** State Recreation Area.
  - home to some of the best beaches and sunny weather on the island.
  - the town of Waimea is also in northeast Kohala - Hawaii's "cowboy" town.
- **Hamakua**
  - the easternmost region, known for its waterfalls, rainforests, and awe-inspiring views.
  - rolling green hills as well as the summit of Mauna Kea, the tallest mountain in the world.
  - massive Jurassic Park-like cliffs and waterfalls on the north side, including Waipio Valley.
- **Hilo**
  - the second most popular region, known for its rainforests, waterfalls, and the town of Hilo.
  - the town of Hilo is the second largest city on the island.
  - this is the wettest, or "windward" side of the island, with the most rainfall.
  - waterfalls (including Akaka Falls) and lush rainforests.
- **Puna**
  - the eastern side of the island, between Hilo and the active lava flows in the National Park.
  - the Puna side of the island is quite rural, with a lot of farmland and the town of Pahoa.
  - a number of black sand beach, including (clothing optional) **Kehena Beach**.
- **Ka'u**
  - the southernmost region, probably the least popular region.
  - the Ka'u side of the island is the most remote, with a lot of farmland and the town of Ka'u.

# Activities

## Hikes & Activities

[Big Island Hiking](https://www.bigislandhiking.com/) is a decent resource for hiking on the Big Island.

#### [Volcanoes National Park](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Hawai%CA%BBi+Volcanoes+National+Park/@19.3091251,-155.5758142,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x795161b6c0b9c9b1:0x3e5b7b263c84ae26!8m2!3d19.4193697!4d-155.2884969)

- has a number of interesting day hikes, lava fields and lava tubes included
- spend the day here just exploring if you need a break from the beach

#### [Waimea Reservoir hike](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Ph3v5QpJCFSbgKas7)

- One of our favourite hikes is in the Waimea area called the Waimea Reservoir hike. It starts [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Ph3v5QpJCFSbgKas7)
- You'll have to climb over a gate at the beginning with some warning signs
- There are these irrigation tunnels and chutes that you can walk through, as well as slide down
- [GPS route](https://www.gaiagps.com/public/AJdD64SMoHWJgIq2kGkSuXXS) - 8km out and back, 105m elevation gain

#### [Pololu Valley](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Polol%C5%AB+Valley/@20.2069494,-155.7357998,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x79537bbce52f757d:0xd0c91adb141d0e8!8m2!3d20.2069444!4d-155.7336111)

- lush valley
- sometimes you can see whales from the shore here
- you can keep going on and on â€“ there's no real "destination"
- [GPS route](https://www.gaiagps.com/public/XMnRO3oER2jiU1czc7Boedg0) - 5km+ out and back, 275m elevation gain

#### [Waipi'o Valley](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Waipio+Valley/@20.1114675,-155.5972385,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x7953768b433a794f:0xbf30be6da781af6!8m2!3d20.1114625!4d-155.5950498)

- this is an amazing valley, but you shouldn't really drive down â€“ it's too steep for most cars.
- the view even from the top is impressive
- you can try hitching a ride down from some locals or walking down the road. You'll feel like a champ if you walk back up.
- there used to be a hike to Hiâ€™ilawe Falls at the back of the valley, but it crossed through private property and is no longer accessible. Do not attempt it.

#### [Kiholo Bay](https://goo.gl/maps/W45NTRzfuQqfPNoPA)

- pretty much guaranteed to see turtles here
- two options
  1. Park by the highway and hike down on gravel
  2. Park near the sea and hike along soft sand
- we generally choose to hike down from the highway, [parking right here](https://goo.gl/maps/TCrFFx4HNmGnJvoA9)
- [GPS route](https://www.gaiagps.com/public/ypRjeWFj4j8TFAJr2pVFBl77) - 4km one way, nominal elevation gain

#### Mauna Kea Summit

- it's a long drive, but the views are absolutely incredible. 4WD is recommended, and your car might struggle with the altitude.
- go at sunset for the best views.

#### [End of the World Cliff Jumping](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pfdkSU72EATG7x1MA)

- a popular spot for cliff jumping at the end of Ali'i drive

#### [South Point](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hYaDUzgEX8oD39JBA)

- the southernmost point in the United States
- some folks do cliff jumping here

## Beaches

As you would expect, the Big Island has a lot of beaches. It also features some unique types of beaches, such as green and black sand beaches.

### White Sand Beaches

#### Kekaha Kai State Park

There are three excellent beaches in this state park. Some are accessible easily, others require a vehicle with a decent amount of ground clearance. You can also hike to the beaches from the parking lot.

I'd recommend hitting up both Mahaiula Beach and Makalawena Beach back to back, as you can park at Mahaiula and walk to Makalawena.

#### [Mahai'ula Beach](https://maps.app.goo.gl/yFuQRnSxJ6rMKkxY8)

- it's a bit of a rough ride getting here, but you can do it with a normal rental car

^^^

^^^ Mahai'ula Beach

#### [Makalawena Beach](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BP1vP4Qpe5r1z6DH9)

- this one requires a high clearance vehicle, or a bit of a walk.
- since it's a bit less accessible, it can be less crowded

#### [Maniniowali Beach](#) (also known as Kua Bay or Mile 88)

- one of the more popular beaches, as it's very easy to access.
- super fun to play in the waves here

#### [Kikaua Beach](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MTyuJ9JjTC3pAwRP8)

- this is a public beach, but you have to access it via private property.
- it's generally very quiet as the parking is so limited. It's also very calm as it's protected by the reef and breakwater.
- first, get a parking pass from the guard shack at the gate (see map)
- if the parking lot is full, you'll have to come back later

#### [Ê»AnaehoÊ»omalu Bay](https://maps.app.goo.gl/KfpLYdhuWWuLN29F8)

- this is a very small beach, just a walk south from the Lava Lava Beach Club in Waikoloa
- not labelled as a beach on most maps, so it's generally quite empty
- easiest to get to at low tide

### Green Sand Beach

#### [Papakolea Beach](https://maps.app.goo.gl/91qgW1hofd8brhNG7)

- one of four green sand beaches in the world
- you can access it by walking from the [parking lot](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qjYKbQb7vUsvpLaz9) or paying for a ride from some locals

### Black Sand Beach

Black sand beaches are common on the Big Island, due to the volcanic activity. They are great to visit, but be sure to wear sandals or water shoes as the sand gets extra hot.

#### [49 Black Sand Beach](https://maps.app.goo.gl/EPmApMRDKB2UJJYY8)

- this is a small black sand beach, but very accessible in the Kohala coast
- it's public, but requires access via private property
- get a pass from the guard shack at the gate, then proceed to the beach (see map)

#### [Punalu'u Beach](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7avnXgCH4rKxgnVR9)

- located in Ka'u, this beach has a very "old Hawaii" vibe to me
- a bit out of the way, but if you're in the area, it's worth a visit
- not the best for swimming

- [Kehena Beach](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uxoGewBoamd8h5Zq8)
  - this beach is in Puna, and clothing optional
  - it's a fairly steep walk down to the beach

## Snorkelling & Paddleboarding

### Snorkelling

The lava rock really attracts sea urchins, so be careful. It's best to wear some sort of water shoes when walking around lava rocks, otherwise you have a pretty good chance of getting pierced (lava is also very sharp!).

#### [Two Step (Pae'a)](#)

- one of our favourite spots
- we're often able to swim with dolphins here (best chance is earlier in the morning) - don't touch them!
- quite popular so arrive early
- you can park on the road and walk down

#### [Kealakekua Bay (Captain Cook)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pWRup8M3jivM2Toc9)

- this is a popular destination for boat tours, but you can also hike down - it's not too difficult of a hike
- park on Napoopoo Road, [near the trailhead](https://goo.gl/maps/tfyotJFMnnZ3dp8c9) (you'll probably see other cars parked)
- go early in the morning to beat the heat
- bring lots of water and food â€“ there's no real shade or services

![](/img/hawaii/captain-cook.jpg)

### Other snorkelling

- If you want to do any snorkelling or scuba diving, I'd recommend [Jack's Diving Locker](https://www.jackdivinglocker.com/) - they are a great local company.
  - night snorkelling with Manta rays is a truly unforgettable experience

#### [Kahaluu Beach Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GpBKh22y1JeEjTFQ8)

- you can take the Kona Trolley here if you're staying in town
- good spot to see turtles as well

### Paddleboarding

We last rented from [Ali'i Adventures in Kona](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bKc8PxJA4mkm88cF9). It's simple to rent for a week and just strap it to the roof of your car.

Our top spot for paddleboarding is actually just the Kona Bay. It's relatively calm, and you're pretty much guaranteed to see dolphins at some point. You can also bring your paddleboard to any of the beaches that are easy to access by car.

## Happy Hour

- [Don's Mai Tai](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BzNhqTz3NbzcDoTUA)
  - claims to have invented the Mai Tai
  - happy hour from 4â€“6 p.m.
- [Kona Brewing Company](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jJzbZZNJpmksBAwc7)
  - no happy hour, but they have a good selection of beers
  - daily tours at 10:30 a.m. and 3 p.m.

  - happy hour from 2â€“5 p.m.
  - excellent mai tais
