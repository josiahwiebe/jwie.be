subtitle: A tool to calculate your last.fm listening stats.

If you use Last.fm to scrobble your music, this app will calculate your listening stats for a set time period.

Inspired by some trouble [Jon](https://jondueck.ca) was having generating his [yearly listening stats](https://jondueck.ca/journal/2024/listening/), this app calculates your Last.fm stats for a set time period.

You'll need a Last.fm API to get your recently scrobbled tracks. You can request one [here](https://www.last.fm/api/account/create).
